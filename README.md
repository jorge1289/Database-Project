#RookieDB
RookieDB is a lightweight, educational database system developed as part of UC Berkeley's CS 186: Database Systems. The project provides a basic foundation for understanding core database concepts and techniques by supporting the execution of simple transactions in series. Throughout the course, advanced features are implemented, focusing on real-world database challenges.

#Features:
B+ Tree Indices: Efficient indexing to improve query performance.

Join Algorithms: Implementing optimized algorithms for joining tables.

Query Optimization: Enhancing query execution plans for faster results.

Concurrency Control: Multigranularity locking for safe concurrent transactions.

Database Recovery: Techniques for recovering databases from crashes or errors.

This project emphasizes building from a minimal skeleton, allowing for a deep understanding of each database component. Itâ€™s an excellent introduction to database internals and system design.

Technical Notes:
The base project is written in Java, with clear separation between the skeleton code and student-implemented components.
